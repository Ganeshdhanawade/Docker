## Start the Docker containers:

    ```code
    docker-compose up
    ```

    Docker Compose will build the images and start the containers. The Flask app will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Stop the Docker containers:

    To stop the containers, use Ctrl+C in the terminal where docker-compose up is running, or run the following command:

    ```code
    docker-compose down
    ```
